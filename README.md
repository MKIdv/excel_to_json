# excel_to_json

A package that allows you to transform your excel to the following format:
1. Excel To JSON

## Getting Started

At current the package allows you to use the following two functions (note: currently xlsx file type gives perfect results):<br />
# 1.convert()<br />
    - automatically lets you pick an excel file and returns a string containing the entire converted json<br /><br />
<br />
For implementation have a look at the attached example file in the github repository.<br />       

Currently Working On:-<br />
    1. Allowing update queries to already uploaded excel files<br />
    2. Converting given excel to pdf<br />
    3. incorporating more file types such as csv.<br />
    4. Allowing more data types currently supports TEXT,REAL,NULL AND INTEGER<br />
